== Overview

In this lab, youâ€™ll learn the practical aspects of developing and running an end-to-end Kafka-based application on OpenShift.

- In the first part, you'll learn how to run Kafka clusters on OpenShift, then get practical instruction on how to monitor 
and tune them for performance and resilience.

- In the second part, you'll learn how to deploy Kafka-based applications on OpenShift by building an end-to-end solution 
of multiple microservices communicating through Kafka. Specifically, you'll learn how to use Debezium to stream database 
changes out of an existing application, how to run Kafka Connect sinks that write streaming data to external systems, 
how to process data streams using Kafka Streams, and how to use create and deploy Kafka microservices using Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes.
