== Overview

In this lab, youâ€™ll learn the practical aspects of developing and running an end-to-end Kafka-based application on OpenShift.

- In the first part, you'll learn how to run Kafka clusters on OpenShift using the http://strimzi.io/[Strimzi Operator], then get practical instruction on how to monitor
and tune them for performance and resilience.

- In the second part, you'll learn how to deploy Kafka-based applications on OpenShift by building an end-to-end solution
of multiple microservices communicating through Kafka.

- In the third part, you'll learn how to use change data capture and https://debezium.io[Debezium] to stream database
changes out of an existing application, and how to run Kafka Connect sinks that write streaming data to external systems.
